# [OMNIFOOD Webpage](https://yanstefanovich.github.io/food-service-website/native/html/index.html)

## Purpose:
This is a webpage for a mock company OMNIFOOD. This is a project was created to practice/better my HTML, CSS and JavaScript writing. I also plan to throw some PHP in the future and deploy it as a website.

This is one of my earlier works, therefore the code is bulky and tangled. I hope to return to this project and refactor the code in the future.

## Features:
* HTML
* SCSS compiled by Koala
* jQuery and Waypoints - site navigation, sticky navigation
* Optimized Images for load speed
* Search Engine Optimization with meta tags
* Google Analytics Integration

## Future To-Do's:
* Refactor the Code
* Integrate PHP for Form Control
* Deploy Website to Heroku
* Update/Change Color Palate
* Add New Background Images
* Add Responsive Images for Mobile Devices
* Improve Mobile Menu and Support
